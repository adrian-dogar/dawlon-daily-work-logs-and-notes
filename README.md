# DAWLON: Daily Worklogs and Notes

Stop using Notepad++ for taking notes just because they are there when you restart. Use Dawlon instead and creating new notes will be a breeze, and they are all timestamped and saved. Weather you like to store your worklogs for each project inside its directory, or you like to have your notes in a specific day-to-day worklog dir. Dawlon is the tool for you.

## Features

The CTRL+N (or CMD+N) command [for creating new text file] is overridden. Now, the new note text file is first created in your local hard drive first and than opened. Filenames are timestamped as `HH-mm-ss`and appended with the `.md` extension. At creation, they are placed inside today's folder, as `YYYY-mm-dd`

Also, as soon as you type in the first line of the file, the filename will be appended with this information. This is useful for quickly identifying the file in the future.
